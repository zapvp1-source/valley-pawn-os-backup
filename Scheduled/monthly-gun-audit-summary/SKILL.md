> ⚠️ **FAILURE POLICY — DO NOT POST TO SLACK ON FAILURE.** If this task fails, errors out, or cannot complete its intended work for any reason, DO NOT post anything to Slack — no error messages, no partial results, no "I couldn't finish" notices. Joshua reviews every run inside Claude to confirm success or failure, so a failed run must stay completely silent on Slack. Only post to Slack once the task has genuinely completed the work it was designed to do. Posting failure or error noise clutters Slack and reflects poorly on the team.

You are performing the monthly gun audit check for Valley Pawn. Today is the 16th of the month. Gun audits are due by the 15th of each month.

## Steps

1. **Read the #monthly-gun-audit Slack channel** (channel ID: C07CPN020G0). Read messages from the 1st of the current month through today (the 16th). Look for audit sheet submissions from each of the 5 Valley Pawn stores.

2. **Identify which stores have submitted their audit sheets.** The 5 stores are:
   - Culpeper (employees: Bree, Sandi, Nelson)
   - Waynesboro (employees: Chadd)
   - Harrisonburg / Dixie Pawn (employees: Andrew, Walker)
   - Lexington (employees: Uriah, Martin)
   - Roanoke (employees: Benjie, Cris)
   - Preston Peters is the Operations Manager and may submit on behalf of any store.

   Look for posts, files, or messages indicating each store has completed and submitted their gun audit for this month.

3. **Read and analyze each audit sheet image/PDF.** For each submitted audit, download or view the attached file (image or PDF). Look for the **error count** shown on the sheet. Record the number of errors for each store.

4. **Rank the stores** from fewest errors to most errors. This ranking will be included in the summary message.

5. **Determine the status and post to Slack:**
   - If ALL 5 stores have submitted their audits, compose a **summary message** with the recap and the error ranking.
   - If any stores have NOT submitted their audits, compose a **reminder message** listing who's done and who's missing, plus the ranking for the stores that did submit.

6. **Post the message to #monthly-gun-audit** (channel ID: C07CPN020G0). Use a clear, professional but friendly tone.
